# NODE.JS-decentralized-network

First thing first, you will need node.js installed on your computer.
! You will need to download node_modules and place it next to the other files you downloaded.

!DESCRIPTION
This is an app, which connects every clients to another 3 clients (MANUALLY, but still working on it) and opens communication between them. You can edit the code (There is a function to edit) to make bots, automated systems, or whatever you want!

!SCRIPTING

Edit the exec() function at the end of the client.js script.
The data variable is the string you received from the network.

!USAGE

Run startClient.bat, type the 3 addresses (or a random string if you don't have any). EXAMPLE: http://192.168.1.30:80
http:// is very important!

Then, give it an open port, and you're fine!

If first connection is ok, it will say 1 Connected.
If the second, 2 Connected, ect...
