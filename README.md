# NODE.JS-decentralized-network
This is an app, which connects every clients to another 3 clients (MANUALLY, but still working on it) and opens communication between them. You can edit the code (There is a function to edit) to make bots, automated systems, or whatever you want!

You will need to download node_modules and place it next to the other files you downloaded.
If you have problems, text me at akos.ducz@gmail.com
